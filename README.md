# Online-Education-Quality
 DMAIC Principles Project

Online education, which utilizes distance-learning modules, has become an integral part of current education system
today. This is mainly due to the growing number of university courses offered online, and the effect of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the educational institutionâ€™s method of delivery. This project examines current support services 
available to online graduate students and presents a quality improvement methodology to be implemented in 
educational institutions.

Employing Six Sigma to examine online learning for graduate students highlights both the strengths of these services 
and the areas that require improvement. This paper concludes that Six Sigma is one of the most suitable analytical 
approach to improve quality aspects for online students, instigating consistent performance through DMAIC 
methodologies. This project will examine current support services available to online students and presents a quality 
improvement methodology to be implemented in educational institutions. Using DMAIC Principals to identify quality 
challenges as online students are facing, analyze the current state of available tools and services. And expound 
guidelines for quality improvement support plan.
